## Process:

The objective is to obtain access to a password protected file that is the logbook of the ship and will reveal its last location.

### 1. Download assets
**Downloaded ship logbook file**

As you can see the logfile is indeed password protected.
  
**Before I dove in an put the file up against software like Hashcat, John the Ripper, etc., I decided to try and crack the password myself with a little social engineering.**


### 2. Analyze the information given in the debrief
