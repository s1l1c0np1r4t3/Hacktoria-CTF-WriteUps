## Description/Debrief

Greetings Special Agent K. Perhaps you remember our old friend Maksim Kotova? After his capture in Panama he was more than willing to cooporate for reduced sentences.

Following up on the leads he’s given us until this point has resulted in the arrest of several high ranking officials and members of various underground organizations. One of his more promising leads, is a military parts smuggling operation organized by one of Maksim’s former Cold War friends, Vasili Semenov.

Semenov is quietly making a fortune selling Russian military spare parts for scraps to the highest bidder. A lot of these parts aren’t even spares in the literal sense of the word. These parts are all brought together through various air bases around Russia and the world, then routed to a central air base. Where they’re exchanged for cash.

Given the current sticky situation around Russian activity. Not to mention the limited jurisdiction of our client. You are tasked with finding the air base where these sales take place.

The old man wasn’t very much into modern technology, so all we have for you is a sattilite image of the air base. Other items found, are sent to a forensics lab by our client.

As always, Special Agent K. The contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

## Process:

The objective is to find the Air Base as it will lead to the password for unlocking the flagfile.

### 1. Analyze the information given in the debrief
**What do I know?**
<ul>
<li>Crash happened near McKenzie National Park in Oregon.</li>
  <li>I know finding the location of the building marked with the red corss in the picture will successfully complete the objective.</li>
  <li>I will use the coordinates to unlock the password file.</li>
</ul>

This is the image:

This the image of the airbase that has been supplied.

Doing a quick reverse google image search on the photograph brings up a lot of air bases, but a few stick out.

If we check out the article that was written on this air base we can see this really looks promising and is very likely the air base we are looking for.

Doing a double check on the coordinates in the articles picture as well as a search for the air base named in the article they both match the air base we are looking for.

Now to find the rest of the information we need to unlock the flagfile lets do a qucik google search on the airbase to find out more information about it and what we need to unlock the flag file and get our Hacktoria Contract card.

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/207452773-504446be-9aca-4658-9c96-945bb1309e21.jpg">

This page has the rest of the information we need on it to unlock the flagfile.

The password is formatted like this:

country-governate-district-airbasename-air-base


Enter it corretly and you unlock the Contract Card!
