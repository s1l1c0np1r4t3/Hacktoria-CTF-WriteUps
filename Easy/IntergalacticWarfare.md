## Description/Debrief

Special Agent K. We have a serious matter on hand today. Klumgongyn has alerted us to the presence of an invasive alien species. Going by the name Krohndahkyr, these creatures are the stuff of nightmares. They lurk in the dark, staying motionless for days or stalking their prey using very heightened senses. Climbing, swimming and making vast leaps as they silently move through the dark.

The Krohndahkyr have the ability to regulate their temperature to the point they become invisible to thermal imaging. Using their many arms and spiked tentacles, they have the ability to rip a human to shreds in seconds.

Just a few hours ago, the Klumgon observed a scout ship of the 2nd Intergalactic Fleet of the Krohndahkyr, crash into earth near McKenzie National Park in Oregon. Shortly after impact, several helicopters arrived. US government personnel took away the wreckage and headed in southern direction. It was at this point that the Klumgon Intergalactic Cruiser, KSP Kerabella, lost sight of the helicopters.

So far any attempts at locating the helicopters has been futile. Making contact with the US government on this matter also brought us nowhere. All we got was laughed at over the phone and told to call a number for special individuals.

Regardless, we need to find the location of these aliens. If the Krohndahkyr manage to get a hold of any human, this will not end well. The Krohndahkyr will either rip them to pieces and disappear into the night and settle our planet. Or shoot their eggs into a human being. Inserted via direct penetration of the chest, the eggs hatch inside the corpse (or live human) within minutes. Eating their host as initial food source, before crawling away to grow into man sized Krohndahkyr in the next week.

Luckily for us, we have a few usual suspects for locations the US government might take alien remains. Mostly due to the fact that aliens always crash into US territory. Also, the Klumgon were able to intercept a broadcast coming from one of the Krohndahkyr’s devices. This indicates they are phoning home. Klumgongyn was able to reconstruct the image data, the encrypted text with coordinates remains unreachable for now. Use the image to locate the exact holding place of the Krohndahkyr so we can take further action.

In the meantime, Klumgongyn is coordinating with the KSP Kerabella, deploying several H-Wing Space-fighters towards our planet. They will keep an eye out for any Krohndahkyr spacecraft closing in. Let’s hope they don’t accidentally shoot down one of Elon’s toys this time. Last thing we need is that guy on our ass.

As always, Special Agent K. The contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

## Process:

The objective is to use the image to locate the exact holding place of the Krohndahkyr.

### 1. Analyze the information given in the debrief
**What do I know?**
<ul>
<li>Crash happened near McKenzie National Park in Oregon.</li>
  <li>I know finding the location of the building marked with the red corss in the picture will successfully complete the objective.</li>
  <li>I will use the coordinates to unlock the password file.</li>
</ul>

This is the image:

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205998476-081bd3cc-09dc-49cb-bcb6-25064fb09897.png">

This the general location of the crash. While there is no official McKenzie National Park in Oregon, I assume the trails and such are what is implied.

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205998587-de34736c-6e15-4986-9183-99e9ed9f7353.png">

I did a quick overview of the area and I was a little perplexed. The picture provided did not match the general landscape of the area where the crash happened. 

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205998747-bce96019-b09d-4ba7-9978-eb7483dd5d82.png">

The picture is clearly more dry. While not impossible to have dry spots even in very green areas, a quick look at the general landscape of the the surrounds locations showed this:

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205998831-4a99c0fe-5a65-4527-a256-1d3a936dc463.png">
<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205998912-15b17b52-b111-4894-87be-9db8b990e125.png">

It was clear to me now it was highly likely that the location I needed to find in the picture was far off from the location of the crash site. The landscapes just did not match. In my opinion the landscape in the photograph was definately more desert than just a dry spot. 

Ok so now what? All I have is this picture. I had to think for a second and reread my debrief. 

"Shortly after impact, several helicopters arrived. US government personnel took away the wreckage and headed in southern direction."

"So far any attempts at locating the helicopters has been futile."

"Regardless, we need to find the location of these aliens."

Ok, I am looking for these aliens that have already been picked up from the crash site by government helicopters.

I glossed over that part and did not consider it while starting my investigation.

So now I expand my search.

But how do I narrow down the possible location with the serach radius being so large now?

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205999006-936baa25-3db6-4180-846c-7a8096515b54.png">

I am now looking for a true desert type area that is within helicopter flight distance. Helicopters have ageneral flight radius of 250 to 400 miles on a single tank. There are, however, better-equipped helicopters, such as certain military helicopters, that can reach up to 1200 miles. So I decided to start with at least the desert climates closest to the crash site.

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205999091-bca9156d-6b51-4a9e-bcec-b1ab05a565d6.png">

With a better look at the at the region and a more likely landscape type area I remembered the information I had skipped over previously. The aliens were picked up by government helicopters. With an idea of a general area and considering the climate is there anywhere in this region that government helicopters might take aliens?

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205999091-bca9156d-6b51-4a9e-bcec-b1ab05a565d6.png">

The well known Area 51 is in Nevada. And we all know the lore about aliens. Maybe that is worth at least checking out?

This is the location that comes up when you search for Area 51:

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205999239-782d7209-3951-45ed-ab91-0ea41b0de8e0.png">
<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205999318-fa6ef11f-c747-4092-869b-bcae530c99c0.png">
 
This looks like a more reasonable search location for the type of climate show in the photograph.

Getting a closer look: 
<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205999370-5a85aaad-a75a-4a69-b7d0-61751a5c4780.png">

Toward the top of the area there was a "A on it's side" shaped road system that was clearly recognizable.

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205999434-392e0258-470b-44b8-803b-d5b18608be1e.png">

Upon further inspection it would seem that this road system is indeed the location we are looking for.

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205999527-46d47c83-d413-49fc-9ce3-555d21615c1e.png">

Getting the exact coordinates of the building we were looking for gets us our password.

However we seem to need exact coordinates using this building to get the password. An anywhere you click on the house causes a small change in the numbers of the longitude and latitude. So how do we find the exact numbers needed from the longitude and latitude to unlock the flagfile?

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205999602-5b3fad47-7c5c-4565-8cec-e82781d2403a.png">

Knowing the amount of numbers in front of the dots might vary from the example depending on location. 

It means there will be four numbers in the L&L after the periods. The numbers infront may vary.

After some trial and error and the longest part of this CTF I finally found it.

Put in the format needed for the password:
country-state-county-161.2570-12.7212

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/205999674-68759d50-a79e-44f9-8e77-e6b9c9bc9913.png">

and you unlock the contract card!
