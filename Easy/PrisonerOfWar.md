## Description/Debrief

Greetings Special Agent K. We have an urgent contract for the government of France. After their official departure from Mali during August 2022, only a few platoons of Special Operation Units remain in the country. Officially, these troops are not present. Unofficially, they are there to protect high ranking politicians and other French partisans.

Two days ago, during a routine escort of a Malian VIP, the convoy was ambushed by unknown insurgent forces. The VIP and most of the convoy managed to return fire and make it out alive. One of the soldiers however, Raphaël Bernard, was hit in the right leg and taken prisoner by the insurgents.

Not being able to reach private Bernard before being captured, French forces were ordered to stand down and not give chase.

Continuing efforts of the French government to locate the missing private have yielded no results. Up until this morning, when a young girl approached a local police unit. She conveyed to them she had escaped a childrens home where she was kept against her will. The man who helped her escape, gave her a picture of the place they were being held. We have reason to believe this man is the missing private, Raphaël Bernard.

The girl approached the officers on the RN1 near “Posté de contrôle KAYES”. Below you find the image given to the girl, as well as the AOR (Area of Operation) of the remaining French detachement.

It’s your job to locate the building where the French private is being held. Once the location is confirmed, French special forces will conduct a raid to extract Raphaël Bernard.

As always, Special Agent K. The contract is yours, if you choose to accept.

## Process:

The objective is to locate the building where it is believed the French Private Raphaël Bernard is being held after an ambush, using only a physical photograph supplied by young girl, the general location of AO of the French detatchment and the exact coordinates of the ambush.


### 1. Analyze the information given in the debrief
**What do I know?**
<ul>
  <li>A convoy was ambushed by unknown insurgent forces, One of the soldiers, Raphaël Bernard, was taken prisoner.</li>
  <li>A young girl escaped a childrens home, supplied a picture of the building where she was being kept given to her by a man (believed to be the captured soldier).</li>
  <li>The ambush took place exactly at "14.495703, -11.156166"</li>
  <li>The girl turned up at “Posté de contrôle KAYE</li>
</ul>

This is the photograph showing the area of the ambush marked in yellow. It's exact location is: 14.495703, -11.156166

This was the photograph supplied by the little girl. It was given to her by someone we believe is our missing Private and is also believed to be the missing privates current location.

“Posté de contrôle KAYES” where the girl turned up.

### 3. Use the information given to try and find the location of the mission soldier

Knowing where the ambush took place and where this girl turned up I made sure to put both of them on a map. 

Knowing from a quick search that child can only walk about 5-10 miles a day considering their age and condition I created a general radius of the possible location of the building.

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/204671228-61ca3262-ad6b-4170-9bdd-f0510c98dda9.png">

Keeping this radius in mind and using the selected area I chose to use Google's Search Nearby function to look for a Childrens home

There was one search result, about 2-3 miles from Posté de contrôle KAYES

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/204671292-abaf6fdb-7014-47c2-80c6-3c5a91da2493.png">
<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/204671334-59d5a4e1-78bb-40b5-a62b-21f6045752c2.png">

Zooming in to this location I immediately noticed both the red sand, greenery around buildings, walls and the circular outdoor structures.

Clicking the google street view avatar I noticed there were a few options to choose from (the tiny blue circles are google street view options
).

I decided to have a look to better see if these buildings or anything matched from the picture. I chose one of the locations first and this is what it looked like

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/204671499-54771da7-5533-430b-a5b4-2be0b750b1a3.png">

There are quite a few things I noticed that matched up with the supplied photo. 

<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/204671546-019b4db3-1c11-4d4a-83bb-30f6db1cc82c.png">
<img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56886006/204671610-4731a050-b981-4514-b2a5-bb39fd7a3bdd.png">

Not only do the circular structures look like a very good match now. But so do the buildings as well. The buildings are the same color, have the same windows, square design near roof, thin roof, short walls and the short walls also have a diamond hole type unique design on them towards the top.

I was extremely confident that I had found the location at this point.

I zoomed back out and and decided to check some of the other street view options.

This is what I found:

BINGO!! Found the exact house in the picture!

Use the name of the childrens home to unlock the file and receive your contract card!

Hope you enjoyed!
